# IMAX Alert — Project Guide

## Commands

```bash
python run.py          # run the app (use_reloader=False intentional — prevents APScheduler double-start)
pytest                 # full test suite
pytest tests/test_app.py -k "TestClassName" -v  # targeted (preferred)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Branching & PR Workflow (Gitflow)

This project follows the Gitflow branching model: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

**Repo:** `dhodge250/IMAX_Alert` — container: `imax-alert`

1. Cut branch from `develop`: `git checkout -b fix/issue-NNN-description origin/develop`
2. Commit, push, PR → `develop`; no reviewer needed
3. After creating the PR, rebuild and restart the local container so the user can test immediately: `docker compose down && docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d`
4. Never merge PRs — create them and let the user approve and merge
5. Never delete branches after merging
6. Run only tests for changed code; full suite only when explicitly asked

**Release cycle:**
1. `git checkout -b release/X.Y.Z origin/develop && git push -u origin release/X.Y.Z`
2. PR `release/X.Y.Z` → `main`
3. After merge: `git checkout main && git pull origin main && git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
4. Tag push triggers Docker Hub CI/CD

**Hotfix cycle:**
1. `git checkout -b hotfix/X.Y.Z origin/main && git push -u origin hotfix/X.Y.Z`
2. PR `hotfix/X.Y.Z` → `main`; separate PR `hotfix/X.Y.Z` → `develop` (to keep branches in sync)
3. After both merged: tag on `main` as above

## Local Testing

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d
docker logs imax-alert -f
```

## Architecture

**App factory:** `create_app(config_name)` in `app/__init__.py`. On startup: runs `_run_migrations()` (idempotent ALTER TABLEs — no Alembic), seeds lookup tables/admin/theaters, loads notification credentials from DB into `app.config`.

**Blueprints:** `auth_bp` (`/login`, `/logout`), `main_bp` (UI, `@login_required`), `api_bp` (`/api`, JSON). `require_role(*roles)` combines login + role check.

**Database:** SQLAlchemy + SQLite/PostgreSQL. Schema changes go in `_run_migrations()` in `__init__.py`, not model-only. `Theater` has legacy string columns and newer FK columns to lookup tables — property helpers fall back to strings during migration.

**Alert model:** `AlertPreference` → `AlertMovie` (join table). Zero `AlertMovie` rows = "any movie." `_migrate_legacy_alert_movies()` back-fills on startup.

**`_get_active_targets()`** returns `{theater_id: set[movie_id]}`. `theater_id=None` = "any theater" alert (applies to all theaters of that chain). `movie_id=None` = "any movie" sentinel. Scrapers merge both sets: `movie_ids = targets.get(None, set()) | targets.get(theater.id, set())`.

**Test fixtures** (session-scoped for performance): `app`, `client`, `auth_client` (logged-in admin), `sample_user`, `sample_theater` (returns ID), `sample_movie` (returns ID). Use `Theater.query.get(sample_theater)` inside `app.app_context()` to get the ORM object.

**Scheduler:** APScheduler `BackgroundScheduler` — scraper every 30 min, venue crawl every 7 days, cleanup every 24 hrs. Demand-driven: only scrapes theaters/movies with active unsent alerts.

**Seeding:** `_seed_theaters_from_csv()` loads `seeds/imax_theaters.csv` on first boot.

**Notifications:** `app/notifications.py` — SMTP email + Twilio SMS. Credentials from `Settings` DB table (not `.env` after startup).

**TMDB:** Optional enrichment via `app/tmdb.py`. Key stored in `Settings`. No-ops when absent.

**Default credentials:** email `admin`, password `admin`.

## Scraper Patterns

**Cloudflare-protected (AMC, Regal):** Playwright headless Chromium for initial page load only. After CF challenge clears, extract cookies via `context.cookies()`, seed a `requests.Session` with them, and make all API calls via `requests` — never `page.evaluate(fetch(...))`, which CF blocks inside Docker.

**Plain HTTP (Cinemark, Cineplex, Royal BC Museum):** `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` directly. No Playwright.

**Playwright + plain requests (TCL):** Playwright fetches the homepage to bypass Cloudflare and extract the `gasToken` from `__NEXT_DATA__`; browser is closed immediately after. All subsequent OCAPI calls use plain `requests` with the token as a Bearer header.

**`scrape_all()` override:** Playwright scrapers (AMC, Regal) override `scrape_all()` to launch one browser and share it across all theaters. Plain HTTP scrapers rely on the base class `scrape_all()`, which calls `scrape_theater()` per theater. When writing a new Playwright scraper, copy the override pattern from `app/scrapers/regal.py`.

**Adding a new scraper:** Create `app/scrapers/chain.py`, then register it in `ALL_SCRAPERS` in `app/scrapers/__init__.py`. Without the registration step the scraper is never called.

**Known date volumes:** Regal ~96 dates, Cinemark ~74 dates. Expect multi-second scrape times per theater even with fast HTTP — this is normal.

**Rules:** No `_MAX_DAYS` cap. `upsert_showtime()` deduplicates. `_movie_wanted()` scopes movies per alert.

**Tests:** HTML/JSON fixtures, test module-level helpers directly, cover IMAX extraction + non-IMAX exclusion + past showtime exclusion + deduplication.

## Release History & Roadmap
